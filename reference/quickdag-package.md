# quickdag: Make Beautiful Directed Acyclic Graphs

This package allows the user the save directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
generated in DiagrammeR and export them to PDF, PNG, SVG, or PS format.
Users may optionally choose to view the DAG without saving or to embed
it in a document. In addition, quickdag allows the user easily to
reformat DAGs as single-world intervention graph (SWIG) templates.
